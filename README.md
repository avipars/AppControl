# Controllr

App that I developed for my Watch Active 2 running tizen

Samsung has officially closed off their Galaxy Store to new Tizen Watch apps and faces.

As a result, I decided to open source my project.

The important part of the code is here https://github.com/avipars/AppControl/blob/main/Wearable/App.cs

The TPK file can be [sideloaded](https://github.com/avipars/AppControl/releases/download/last/release.tpk) to your watch if you want to try and use the app! 

The project is written in C# and XAML using .Net 7 


## Features

* Shows IP, MAC address 

* Toggle bluetooth button

* Accssibility shortcut

* Visibiilty shortcut

* Watch battery indicator

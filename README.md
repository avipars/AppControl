# AppControl
App that I developed for my Watch Active 2 running tizen

Samsung has officially closed off their Galaxy Store to new Tizen Watch apps and faces.

As a result, I decided to open source my project.

The TPK file can be sideloaded to your watch if you want to try and use the app!

The project is written in C# and XAML using .Net 7 

## Features

* Shows ip address
